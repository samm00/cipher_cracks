# cipher_cracks

This is a place for me to dump code that breaks ciphers. Hopefully it will grow in the future.

### vigenere_crack

Cracks Vigenere Cipher using frequency analysis for sufficiently large English text (though the key can be any combination of letters in the English Alphabet)

Input asks for the name of a plaintext file. Punctuation, space will removed; case will be normed. Output to a txt file.
